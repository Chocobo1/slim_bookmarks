This page, <code>about/index.html</code>, is an example of a named
<code>html</code> file. Named files are not placed in <code>_posts/</code>.<br/>
<br/>

Remember that this is not a markdown file so <code>`_posts/`</code> will not
work like it does in <code>_posts/*.md</code>. Instead, you need to use
<code>&lt;code&gt;_posts/&lt;/code&gt;</code>.
